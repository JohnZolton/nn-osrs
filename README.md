# Learning Machine Learning to cheat at OSRS

not really, its all simulated. But I'm teaching neural nets to play old school runescape with simulated boss battles.

DQN, PPO etc

TL/DR - build a simulated environment with ticks, boss info, attacks, health, food, gear etc, represent that as a vector, and train NNs to take action and through reinforcement learning, defeat the boss.

Starting with Phosani
